# DungeonCrawler
for my 331 class will have an extremely  basic  game linked to a server on local host with udp 
the client and server are in the same class so all you need to do to run it is actually run it on your personal computer
to change the port that the udp connects on simply change the variable port in the main class (miniproject331)
